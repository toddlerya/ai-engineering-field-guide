# Theory Questions

Based on candidate reports from Reddit, X, and personal blogs about what they were actually asked in AI engineering interviews.

This section covers knowledge-based questions: "What is X?", "How does X work?", "Explain Y".

## Format

Typically 45-60 minutes, conversational. The interviewer asks conceptual questions to probe your understanding of AI/ML topics. There is no coding or whiteboard - just a back-and-forth discussion.

Theory questions rarely appear as a standalone round. They're usually woven into other rounds: system design, project deep dives, or dedicated AI/ML technical screens. Some companies have a dedicated "LLM theory" or "AI deep-dive" round, but more commonly these questions surface as follow-ups when you mention a concept and the interviewer wants to see how deep your understanding goes.

## Specialized Topics

These topics are not asked by default in AI engineering interviews.

They come up when the job description specifically requires them - for example, a role focused on model training or a research-adjacent engineer role. If the posting doesn't mention fine-tuning or transformer internals, you're unlikely to be asked about them.

### Fine-tuning and Training

- What is instruction tuning and how does it differ from pre-training? [^hn-46319888] [^llmgenai] [^reddit-llm-interview-prep]
- What is PEFT/LoRA and when would you use it? [^fahd-mirza] [^reddit-genai-consulting] [^x-interviewstack-meta] [^x-aryyann8] [^reddit-llm-interview-prep]
- Explain the RLHF pipeline: supervised fine-tuning, reward model training, and PPO. How does DPO simplify this? [^proptech-founder-1]
- Explain quantization. What are the trade-offs between model size, speed, and accuracy? [^raghu-teja-2] [^reddit-llm-interview-prep]
- How do you convert implicit user behavior (edits, acceptance, rejection) into training signals for model improvement? [^bhavishya-pandit]
- How would you design a model that can solve math problems? Walk through data collection, supervised fine-tuning, post-training, and evaluation. [^igotanoffer]


### LLM Theory

- How do transformers work? [^proptech-founder-2] [^reddit-genai-consulting] [^reddit-ai-eng-questions] [^process-analysis]
- What is the self-attention mechanism? [^sundeep-teki]
- Explain the difference between encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder Transformer architectures. When would you use each? [^tidorp] [^hn-46319888] [^reddit-llm-interview-prep]
- What is KV cache? How does it help in LLM inference? [^igotanoffer] [^reddit-llm-interview-prep]
- What is Mixture of Experts (MoE)? How does it improve efficiency? [^mimansa-jaiswal]
- What are the differences between BPE, WordPiece, and character-level tokenization? What are the trade-offs? [^fahd-mirza]



## How to Prepare

Focus on practice over theory. Interviewers care more about how you build, evaluate, and operate AI systems than about transformer internals. The most common questions test RAG systems, agents, and production concerns.

- RAG systems - build a working pipeline end-to-end
- Agents - understand the full architecture: planning, tool use, memory, termination. Key questions: when NOT to use agents
- Testing and evaluation - be able to describe how you build golden datasets

Common mistakes:

- Describing how to build systems but not how to evaluate or monitor them
- Not being able to explain trade-offs - just knowing what something is without knowing when to use it
- Ignoring cost, latency, and failure modes - interviewers want production thinking, not prototype thinking
