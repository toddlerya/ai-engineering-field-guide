## Project Deep Dive

Project deep dive (also called "technical project presentation") is an interview round where you present a past project and get grilled on technical decisions.

- Tell me about a project you're most proud of, and what role you played. (OpenAI) [^igotanoffer-openai]
- Tell me about a recent/favorite project and some of the difficulties you had. (Meta) [^igotanoffer-meta]

### Follow-up Probes

These are the probing questions interviewers ask during project deep dives to test depth of understanding:

- Why did you choose that particular storage/model/architecture over alternatives? [^exponent-openai]
- Is there an actual eval framework here, or is it vibes-based? (OpenAI) [^exponent-openai]
